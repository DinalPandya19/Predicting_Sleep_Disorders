# 💤 Predicting Sleep Disorders

This project uses machine learning to predict sleep disorders, specifically **None**, **Insomnia**, and **Sleep Apnea**, based on demographic, lifestyle, and health factors.

## 📊 Project Objective:
To build a classification model that helps predict the type of sleep disorder in individuals, enabling early detection and personalized care.

## 🔍 Key Highlights:
- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values using appropriate imputation techniques.
- Feature Engineering: Applied encoding techniques and feature selection for better model performance.
- Model Building: Used Decision Tree and Random Forest for classification.
- Evaluation: Compared models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

## 🎯 Target Column:
`sleep_disorder`  
- 0 = None  
- 1 = Insomnia  
- 2 = Sleep Apnea

## 📈 Outcome:
Achieved improved model performance after data cleaning and feature engineering. Random Forest showed strong results in predicting sleep disorders.
